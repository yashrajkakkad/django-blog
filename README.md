# Simple Django Blog Application

Blog application created as a part of [Django Girls Tutorial](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/). Uses SQLite as database.

This is where I began learning Django. If you're looking forward to learn this powerful framework, this tutorial is perhaps the go-to place.

## Instructions

- Install the required packages. You'll ideally want to do this in a virtual environment.
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  
- Create a '.env' file and store a random strong 'SECRET KEY'

  ```
  SECRET_KEY='YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE'
  ```

- Run the server
  ```bash
  python manage.py runserver
  ```
